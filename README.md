# DevOps Fundamentals Exam

The tasks use a project template constructed during the course and are modifed to fit the needed tasks. Both task are controlled by executing ./deploy.sh ./destroy.sh scripts. For proof of work all commands are executed with tee logging to the log folders of the specific tasks. Dates within the log files are in UTC.

```bash
./deploy.sh 2>&1 | tee "log/deploy $(date).log"
./destroy.sh 2>&1 | tee "log/destroy $(date).log"
``` 

Both tasks use the vagrant trigger up functionality to remotely execute "sync/scripts/salt_init.sh". The script calls salt to apply the active configurations to specified VMs in the infrastructure. Salt itself is deployed by the build in salt provisioner that comes included with vagrant.

>NOTE: The Salt provisioner is builtin to Vagrant. If the vagrant-salt plugin is installed, it should be uninstalled to ensure expected behavior.
> - [Documentation](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/provisioning/salt)

Keys for salt are pre generated by /sync/scripts/gen_salt_keys.sh and packaged with the rest of the files. Automating regeneration is not implemented.

Using a bash script to controll salt appears to be a quicker solution to using the requisites mechanism and simplifies reusability.
